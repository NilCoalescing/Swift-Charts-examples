In this repository we are collecting code examples from [Nil Coalescing blog](https://nilcoalescing.com/blog/) related to the [Swift Charts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts) framework. The blog articles that you can find under the [Charts tag](https://nilcoalescing.com/tags/charts/) explain these examples in detail and provide screenshots of the resulting charts.
